Web Scraping IMDB page of all Oscar Awards Best Picture winners

For a final project, my team and I scraped an IMDB page of all of the movies that have won the Best Picture Award at the yearly Oscar Awards. From the page, we scrape information including the movie name, release year, director & actor names, film runtime, IMDB rating value, movie gross, and more.
